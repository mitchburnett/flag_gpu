BeamformerBackend.py should be placed in $DIBAS_DIR/lib/python
dibas.conf should be placed in $DIBAS_DIR/etc/config

Before clobbering any GB configurations, I would backup these files on their end.
dibas.conf is significantly different than the one found at GB.

This requires the flag_gpu plugin to be installed. The version that must be installed is the "controlled" version, which is found in flag_gpu/controlled/correlator/src.

There are runtime parameters that are set by the dibas.conf file.

For example:

[BANKA]
...
data_destination_host = 10.0.0.1 # The 10 GbE IP address/hostname on which data arrive
data_destination_port = 60000    # Ditto, but the fabric port
...
xid = 3           # The Xengine ID
instance = 2      # The hashpipe instance ID
gpudev = 0        # The GPU device ID
cpus = 0, 1, 2, 3 # The CPU cores that the threads should run on


[FLAG_BETA_MODE1]
...
hpc_program = hashpipe
hpc_program_flags = -p flag_gpu
...


In future revisions, the thread names will likely also reside in the MODE definition
